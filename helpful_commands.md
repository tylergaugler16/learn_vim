# Helpful Commands

## General 
Many commands follow a format:
command + motion

example: dw
command = d (delete)
motion = w (word)

You can also put a number before a motion to repeat it:
2w - navigate two words
d5w - delete five words


### Motions
w = word(including the proceding space) ðŸ”¥
b = back a word(excluding the preceding space)
e = word(exlcuding the proceding space)
$ = end of line
0 = begginning of the line
G = end of file
gg = begginning of the file

## Text Editing Commands
These only work when you are in "Normal" mode

### Deletion Commands
 
* dw - delete word
* d$ - delete to the end of the line
* de - delete word(but only to the end of the current word, as in it wont delete the proceding space)
* d0 - delete to the begginning of the line
* dd - delete to the end of the line(this is a default shortcut) ðŸ”¥
